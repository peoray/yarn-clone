# BYBORRE - technical assignment

# Digital Product Engineer Assignment - Frontend

Build the functionality described in [Requirements](#requirements) and use the Figma file provided to you for design direction.

You may approach it any way you want, with the only constraint being that we would only like for you to spend 1-2 hours maximum on the exercise.

We would like you to focus on:

1. Architecture rather than tools/libraries/frameworks. You may use any tools you want, as long as you can explain us why you think they are a good fit for this particular exercise.
2. Re-usability/maintainability. For example, we might ask you how much effort would be involved in adding an additional select list (yarn supplier), for which the available options are dependent on the value of the first select list (yarn material).
3. Testability. We don't expect you to provide test coverage as part of the exercise (although you surely may if you want to), but you should be able to explain how your code is testable.

You don't have to:

1. Make it pixel perfect.
2. Make it work flawlessly in every browser.

We also encourage you to:

1. Add some technical documentation to the `DOCS.md` file detailing your approach and considerations.
2. Use the elements you see fit for the UI, you are not limited using the `select` element.
3. Use your creativity, make enhancements as you see fit.

## Requirements

1. The component should load application data from `/src/data/yarn-colors.json`
2. It should display a list of 6 yarn color cones
3. Each yarn cone, when clicked, should show a popup with an available list of colors ("Yarn Library")
4. When selecting a color from the Yarn Library, the yarn cone should reflect the change and show the new selected color
5. All 6 yarn cones should be able to be updated with any of the colors available in the 'Yarn library' popup
